# Major Theming Update (v8.0.0-beta)

>**Major Theming Update:**  
> This BETA version features a refresh of our theme tokens to use Figma Variables!  
> Since this is a breaking change, upgrading to this BETA will require modifications to your project to adapt to the new theming system.

## Token Migration Script

> In anticipation of this token refresh, we have prepared a Token Migration script that can recursively replace token names throughout your entire projectâ€™s codebase when upgrading to v8-beta.  
> [Find the repository and details here](https://github.com/mmctech/atlas-token-migration).

## Recommended for New Projects

> Due to the potential impact on existing projects, we recommend using this BETA release only for new projects or if you are prepared to implement the necessary changes.  
> Bug fixes through Q4 will continue to be applied to both v7.0.0 and v8.0.0-beta.

## Stabilizing the BETA

> As we stabilize this BETA, patches will ensure fully functional theming throughout the system.  
> Please report any issues so we can address them promptly.  
> We are targeting the end of Q4 to release Atlas v8 to production!
