# Documenting 

When documenting, keep in mind that the audience are not just `Developers` and `Designers`, but also `Delivery Leads`, `Business Analysts`, `Product Owners`, `Product Testers` and more.

The goal of the documentation is that they can understand and use the design system effectively and efficiently.

## Documentation areas

Different documentation areas, helps different stakeholders, we are going to divide this areas in four: `Introduction`, `Examples`, `Design`, `API`.

### Introduction

The component `name`, a small `description` of what the component does and the component `state`.
This will help different stakeholders to understand what is the purpose of the component.

The component states are:

- Experimental: When the component is not following all the standards or it's not ready for production yet. Breaking changes are expected. Experimental components can be deprecated.

- Alpha: The component is not ready for production yet, the alpha components can be deprecated.

- Beta : The component is not completely stable yet. Frequent updates are expected.

- Deprecated: New adopters should not use deprecated components, if the adopters are using a deprecated cmoponent, they should migration instructions.
Deprecated components should include migration instructions.

- Stable: Components that are stable and productionr eady, all things are operational, the component is properly documented and follows standards.

To inform about the state of the component, include a badge in the component stories in the following way:

```ts
export default {
  title: 'Components/ComponentExample',
  component: ComponentExample,
  parameters: {
    badges: [ BADGE.EXPERIMENTAL ], // include this badges parameter with the component state, EXPERIMENTAL indicates the component is still experimental.
  ...
```

**Consumers**: The introduction is useful for everyone.

### Examples

Examples are useful to illustrate how the component behaves with different states and configurations.

For showing examples we create `stories` for those different configurations, there is no need to create a story per configuration,
but it's a good idea to illustrate scenarios that are commonly used.

Check the documentation about [how to create stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/writing-stories/introduction).

**Consumers**: The examples are useful for everyone.

### Design (optional but recommended)

The design area should include links to designs and UX documentation. Do's and Don'ts of the component and other guidelines about how and when to use the component.

**Consumers**: The design is useful for everyone.

### API

When developing a component we need to document every public method, property and the @Input's and @Output's.

We use compodoc to generate static documentation based on comments in files.

Every supported comment will generate documentation automatically.

Example of supported comment:

```ts
/**
 * Supported comment
 */
```

Please note that these comment styles are not supported by compodoc:

```ts
/*
 * unsupported comment
 */

/*
  unsupported comment
 */

// unsupported comment
```

#### VSCode

In VSCode, when documenting a function, you can press /** followed of enter, and it will generate a documentation structure with the params and return.

Example of documenting a method with parameters:

```ts
/**
 * This function calculates the sum of two values.
 * @param a a value to sum
 * @param b another value to sum
 * @returns the result a+b
 */
sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Storybook

Your new commented spec should now be visible in the DOC tab in Storybook after rebuilding.
