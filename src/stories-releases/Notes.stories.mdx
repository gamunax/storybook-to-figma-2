## v1, v2 Migration Guide

Welcome to the MOSUI migration docs. This page will help you chose the right path for your application to migrate from Brighter or v1 to MercerOS v3.


### From Atlas (aka v1)

<img src={v1v2} alt="Migration" width="100%"/>

The MercerOS v3 library is a new library that is not directly compatible with the Atlas library themes and components. A direct migration from v1 to the MercerOS v3 library is not supported. Atlas v1 offers a simple path to migrate to use v2 theme modeling for core style sets (color palettes and swatches, type settings and grids). Once your application has completed this initial upgrade, you can proceed to determine the next steps to leverage the latest libraries and themes.

For more info on this migration please refer to our [v1-2 migration docs](https://cryptic-dusk-44035.herokuapp.com/docs/notes).

### From Brigher (aka v2)

If your application is using the Brigher theme library, you can migrate to MercerOS v3 by following one of two paths. Path A is a time saver, while Path B is the preferred technical path for MercerOS v3 to work as intended.

#### Path A

> I want to continue to use my Brighter components, but I want to enable "v3" theme modeling for core style sets (color palettes and swatches, type settings and grids).

<img src={migration} alt="Migration" width="100%"/>

In this case, please follow our [v2-3 migration guide here](https://nameless-woodland-82859.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/docs/brand-migration--docs).

#### Path B

> I want to replace my current components with MercerOS v3 components. 

MercerOS v3 contains a brand new set of components and has a similar but improved theming model as the v2-3 migration state. Replacing or refactoring Front End is required to use these new components. Although experimental in nature, you can use this package in conjunction with Brighter/Atlas packages.

In this case, you can simply get started with our [MercerOS v3 setup guide](?path=/docs/get-started-setup--docs).
