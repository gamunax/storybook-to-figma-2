# Grid System

Atlas's Grid is entirely customizable to fit the breakpoints and spacing you need to build your application.

## Get Started

Use the grid by including the generate-grid() mixin in your project's main scss file.

```css
@include generate-grid();
```


## Default Configuration

These are the out of the box values. Simply calling the mixin without changing params loads this grid setup:

<table class="outer-table">
<tbody>
<tr><th>Properties </th><th>Breakpoints</th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Property | Default Value |
|--|--|
| max-width | 1184px |
| columns | 12 |
| gutter | 19px |

</td><td>

| Breakpoint | Default Value |
|--|--|
| xsmall | 0 |
| small  |  375px |
| medium |  768px |
| large  | 1280px |
| xlarge | 1440px |

</td></tr> 
</tbody>
</table>


## The Basics


Use the container class to contain your .row and column structure. This uses $max-width set by the `generate-grid` mixin. For full width, simply remove the outer `.container` div. The columns align up to the number of columns set in $grid-columns.

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            ...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```



## Breakpoints


Breakpoints are used throughout the system for column sizing, as well as in the respond-to and from media query helpers. In our core, the `$halo-breakpoints` map is flagged as a `!default` value only. Add this map to your `style.scss` to customize keys or breakpoint values.

```css
$atlas-breakpoints: (
    xsmall : 0,
    small : 375px,
    medium : 768px,
    large : 1280px,
    xlarge : 1440px,
);
```


## Utils


#### Responsive Columns

Our columns can be set to different values for each breakpoint. These each take up 1/3rd of the total column size (12 / 4) on medium up and are full width and stacked (12 / 12) on small up.

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="column medium-4 small-12">...</div>
    <div class="column medium-4 small-12">...</div>
    <div class="column medium-4 small-12">...</div>
</div>
```

Using the breakpoint columnn classes will set the columns to use X columns at Y breakpoint and up. Multiple can be used together to define how the same column reacts to different breakpoints.

#### Media Queries

Our media queries are simple to use once along side the breakpoint mappings. Using the respond-to mixin creates CSS at Y breakpoint and DOWN.

```css
@include respond-to(breakpoint)
```

Using the respond-from mixin creates CSS at Y breakpoint and UP.

```css
@include respond-from(breakpoint)
```


#### Column offset

Each column can directly be offset by a column value for each breakpoint.

```css
.breakpoint-up-offset-X
```

Using the offset-up classes creates an X column offset at Y breakpoint and UP.

```css
.breakpoint-down-offset-X
```

Using the offset-down classes creates an X column offset at Y breakpoint and DOWN.

#### Hide content

Use our breakpoint hiding classes to hide a div on a particular breakpoint.

```css
.hide-breakpoint-up
```

Using the offset-up classes hides the node at Y breakpoint and UP.

```css
.hide-breakpoint-down
```

Using the offset-down classes hides the node at Y breakpoint and DOWN.

#### Align content

```css
.breakpoint-align-center
```

Using the align class on a column aligns it's contents at Y breakpoint and UP.

#### Column utils

```css
.shrink
```

Using the shrink class sets the column to auto sizing based on it's contents using flex auto.
