# Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb is a secondary navigation pattern that helps a user understand the hierarchy among levels and navigate through them. Consists of a trail of links representing the current page and its “ancestors” leading back to the site homepage. The home page (or root node of the hierarchy) is the first link and the links are usually separated by a symbol like “>” or “/”.  They are especially useful when users arrive to the site through an external link and don’t start with the homepage.
