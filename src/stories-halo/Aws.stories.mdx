# AWS Guide

Follow this guide to setup authentication with Halo's AWS.

## Get your credentials

Ask for your credentials to the DevOps team in the #devops Slack channel or [Devops JIRA board](https://halo-react-team.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DEVOPS/boards/72). They will send you something like this: 

**To configure aws-cli:**

> Access key ID: AKIATXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Secret access key: vR0uVNRUkXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Default region: us-east-1
> 

**To  access AWS console:**

> url: [https://242322062111.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://242322062111.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)
Usuario: john.smith
Password: XXXXXX
> 

## AWS console access

To access CodeArtifact service UI, go to the next link and log-in using your credentials:

[https://242322062111.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://242322062111.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)

Once you're logged in go to:

[https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codeartifact/home?region=us-east-1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codeartifact/home?region=us-east-1)

In the console you can see "halo" domain and "halo-libraries" repository.

## Install aws-cli

To be able to use the above repo. you need to install aws-cli, please follow the instructions in this link depending on your OS:

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

Then, in a terminal, run the command below and complete the questions using the information provided in the previous steps by the DevOps team:

```bash
aws configure
```

## Create the registry configuration file

**Automatic process:**

This command will create the file ~/.npmrc to use CodeArtifact repo. globally for npm:

```bash
aws codeartifact login --tool npm --repository halo-libraries --domain halo --domain-owner 242322062111
```

**Manual process:**

If you want to use CodeArtifact repo only for a specific project, move that file to the root folder of your project or use the following commands:

1. Export a CodeArtifact authorization token for authorization to your repository from your preferred shell (token expires in 12 hours).

```bash
export CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN=`aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --domain halo --domain-owner 242322062111 --query authorizationToken --output text`

```

2. Copy the configuration into your home directory (~/) or project .npmrc file. If the 

.npmrc file does not exist, create one.

```bash
registry=https://halopowered-242322062111.d.codeartifact.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/npm/halo-libraries/
[//halopowered-242322062111.d.codeartifact.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/npm/halo-libraries/:always-auth=true](https://halopowered-242322062111.d.codeartifact.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/npm/halo-libraries/:always-auth=true)
//halopowered-242322062111.d.codeartifact.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/npm/halo-libraries/:_authToken=${CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

## Autologin

CodeArtifact authorization tokens have a lifetime of 12 hour maximum, this means that after 12 hours you'll need to run the login command again to update the data in your .npmrc file like this:

```bash
aws codeartifact login --tool npm --repository halo-libraries --domain halo --domain-owner 242322062111
```

Another possibility is to add to your crontab some lines that will do the login for you.

In a terminal run:

```bash
crontab -e
```

and copy this lines into our crontab file and save the file:

```bash
PATH="/usr/local/bin"
CODEARTIFACT_LOGIN="/usr/local/bin/aws codeartifact login --tool npm --repository halo-libraries --domain halo --domain-owner 242322062111"

@reboot ${CODEARTIFACT_LOGIN} > /tmp/codeartifact.log 2>&1
0 9 * * 1-5 ${CODEARTIFACT_LOGIN} > /tmp/codeartifact.log 2>&1
```

The above lines will run the login command on reboot and at 9:00 am from Monday to Friday. If this schedule doesn't fit your needs you can change it.
