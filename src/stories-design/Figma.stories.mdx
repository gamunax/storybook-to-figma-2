## Design Language
Welcome to the heart of our Figma file, your compass to the design system. Here, you'll discover our foundational Theme settings and Typography guidelines that collectively form the essence of our visual language. Use this section to influence and inspire your design journey.

## Components
In the Components section of our Figma file, you'll find a variety of pre-designed elements. These elements, integral to our design system, provide consistency and can be customized to suit your unique design needs.
