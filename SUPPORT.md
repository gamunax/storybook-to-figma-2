# SUPPORT INTRODUCTION
## ATLAS DESIGN SYSTEM

Welcome to Atlas!

Hello friends! This section aims to provide details about everything our Support Team can help you with, from implementation issues, configuration problems, to new suggestions. 

**Note:** Before you click on the links below for "Known Issues" and/or "Discussions", you should previously check to make sure you have the necessary permissions set up to access GitHub. In case you don't have access please make the corresponding request.

First, our known issues are here: [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/mmctech/proxima-atlas/issues)

To report an **issue (bug** or **enhancement)** you may do so in this same page following the template's guidelines with all the required information. 

We are working towards solving them, please bear in mind that our Support process involves triaging all issues raised with our Mercer POD Lead and resolution times will vary, based on that prioritization, and our team capacity.

To ask questions or look for previous debates go to: [**Discussions**](https://github.com/mmctech/proxima-atlas/discussions) 

We hope this site provides the necessary support for your team! However, if the above forums and pages do not answer your question, feel free to reach out through email to:
